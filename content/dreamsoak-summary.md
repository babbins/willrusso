"Will Russo's Dreamsoak speaks to us with an uncanny braid of eloquence and strangeness, as if simultaneously channeling the rhetorical decorum of Yeats and the hallucinatory power of Rimbaud. ﻿Russo makes his poems sparkle in their exploration of innovative forms that scurry across the page, yet he also draws from the oldest sources of lyricism: longing, loneliness, despair, desire, and a keen attentiveness to the world as experienced through the senses. These poems fill me with delight and joy. Even on the grayest days of winter, they are a kind of "[d]aylight / filling the lung of my living room."
