"This act of taking words, phrases, and lines from different sources and mixing them with his own lyrical aphorisms gives Russo’s poems their elusive, enigmatic mysticality. Like a mirage, their meaning moves further from reach the more you read them." — [Drishya](https://phillychapbookreview.org/resistance-and-resignation-in-will-russos-glass-manifesto/)
